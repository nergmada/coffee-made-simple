# Coffee Made Simple
## Introduction
Coffee Made Simple is an open source lightweight backend
content management system built on NodeJS.

## Why?
Coffee Made Simple started because I realised I was building a massive
chunk of the same every time I coded a new application. And that
was a backend system for managing content. So I thought why not
abstract this away and provide the kind of tools I would like to have
when developing apps.


Content is a set of Assets

Assets are different types such as

- Text
- Body Text
- Image 
- etc

coffee provides access to mongoDB via CRUD operations
